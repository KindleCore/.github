## Making Minecraft server moderation easy

KindleCore is a small organization of two individuals creating a system that can help server administrators and moderators manage their server and plugin configurations. Our goal is to help those who don't have the knowledge or experience manage their servers without having to touch configuration files - just a single file upload to manage your entire server from an interactive user interface.
