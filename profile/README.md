## Making Minecraft server moderation easy

KindleCore is a small organization of two individuals creating a system that can help server administrators and moderators manage their server and plugin configurations. 

Our goal is to help those who don't have the knowledge or experience manage their servers without ever having to touch a configuration file - just a single file upload to manage your entire server from an interactive user interface.

**KINDLECORE** ALONG WITH ANY MATERIAL WITHIN THIS ORGANIZATION IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH MOJANG. MINECRAFT IS A TRADEMARK OF MOJANG SYNERGIES AB.

*Please note that most (if not all) of the repositories within this organization are privated.*
